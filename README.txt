To make it work you need to add everything in the style.css file into your style.css file (just copy paste it above/below the import thing).

You also need to put the panel.js file somewhere and reference it in any page you want to have that navigation (usually goes in a "js" or "scripts" folder, then you call it whatever).

everything inside of the HTML file has comments above it explaining its purpose. 

I would suggest copy/pasting everything that has a comment above it starting with the <nav> tag

If you're unsure about something ask me!
