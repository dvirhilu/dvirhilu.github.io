<h1>
    Undergraduate Thesis - An Architecture to Allow Direct File-System Access on GPU
</h1>

<p>
    Starting in late January 2022, I joined Dr. Alexandra (Sasha) Fedorova's research group to complete an undergraduate thesis. This page contains a brief summary of the work, and the paper is embedded at the bottom.

<h2>
    Background Information
</h2>

<p>
    The group identified a bottle neck in many modern workloads which require massive parallelization and data handling: Many of these workloads operate largely on specialized processors (such as GPUs), and use a centralized CPU only to coordinate between subsystems and facilitate data transfers. Noting that many periferals today have their own processors (SSDs, smart NICs, memory), the group envisioned a decentralized, CPU-less system, in which independent, specialized devices communicate together to execute workloads.
</p>
<p>
    As a first step to this vision, the team wanted to explore the possibility of direct communication between a GPU and a file system implemented in the SSD. As a proof of concept, a hardware emulator was used to simulate the external file system, and I worked on starting the implementation of direct file access on the GPU side.
</p>
<p>
    As I only had a few months for the thesis, I prioritized coming up with an architecture that accomplish the task on the GPU, and writing a simple proof of concept code for how this architecture that would interact with the hardware emulator.
</p>
<p>
    Before giving a brief explanation of the architecture, here is some basic, relevant information about the architecture of a GPU:

    The GPU is made up of a large number of simple processors (think an army of babies). To handle
