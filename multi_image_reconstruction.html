<h1>
    Signal Processing Project - 3D Reconstruction of Objects from Multiple Images
</h1>

<p>
    To learn more about and explore classical signal and image processing techniques, I worked on a project to generate
    a 3D point cloud of an object from multiple images. I decided to use this project as the final project for one of my
    courses at UBC, and as a result I wrote an IEEE style paper about it, which is embeded below.
