    <h1>
        UBC Subbots
    </h1>

    <p>
        for four years (two of those as team captain), I was part of UBC Subbots: a student design team at UBC making 
        an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV).
    </p>

    <h2>
        Management Experience
    </h>

    <p>
        As team captain, I focused on expanding the technical capabilities of the robot for the new design. As a young
        team, the first revision of the robot was mostly focused on creating a functioning, driving AUV. For the new 
        revision, I planned to add an acoustic localization system and actuators that will allow us to complete 
        competition tasks beyond navigation. Due to the increase in design complexity, the team roughly doubled in 
        size. To allow for a smooth transition, I focused on facilitating and ensuring good communications between 
        sub-team leads, and held weekly status meetings to ensure sub-teams were up to date on each others' 
        progress. The overall team structure is shown in the image below. 
    </p>

    <h3>
        Main Challenges
    </h3>

    <p>
        A huge challenge I faced on the management side was helping the team navigate through Covid. All team 
        operations had to be moved fully online for a period of a year and a half, and I needed to find a way
        to continue progress on the project in a fully remote setting. I used this as an opportunity to do a 
        full re-design of the robot, and add the acoustic localization and actuator systems. At the same time,
        I worked with UBC's design team management to send some equipment to a few team members to allow them
        to conduct more hands on work.

    <h2>
        Acoustic Localization System - Project Dolphin
    </h2>

    <p>
        One of my main contributions to the team was leading a project to build an acoustic localization system. This
        system uses hydrophones to capture sound from underwater pingers of known frequency, and computes the direction
        of the pinger relative to the robot. Initially, I created a simulator to test various localization algorithms.
        The simulator was made of modular "stages" that the signal could pass through (signal generation, error injection,
        filters, digitizers, and the localization algorithm stages). The idea was to have a modular structure where we can
        pick and choose various stage combinations.

    <p>
        Alongside testing localization algorithms in the simulator, the team focused on ironing out the system hardware.
        This includes exploring various analog filter designs, triggers to begin data collection, and which processor to
        use for computation. A diagram of the overall architecture of the system is shown below, indicating the signal
        progression throughout the system

    <h3>
        Main Challenges
    </h3>

    <p>
        This project was a big undertaking for our team, as we had to design the entire system from scratch, with 
        a limited budget and limited space in the water-proof enclosure. We started by breaking up the project
        scope into more manageable chunks - the simulator to test localization algorithms, the analog filter and
        pre-amplifier near the hydrophones, selecting the right processor for the system, etc. At the same time
        it was critical to continuously communicate with the software and mechanical teams to ensure our design
        decisions align with their work.
